    /// This method doesn't actually change the timing of the recurring timer. An interval timer
    /// will fire exactly at the interval specified originally. This just allows the kernel poller
    /// to received the timer event and send a notification. On epoll based systems if a timer has
    /// already fired because the timer period has elapsed, the kernel poller will be woken up
    /// immediately after this call and a notification will be sent. This should not be a problem in
    /// practice as timers should be re-armed before the next timer fires. Otherwise the timer
    /// interval is too short to be useful.
    ///
    /// On Linux timers are file descriptors registered with epoll. Since we use edge triggering we
    /// need to read the file descriptors to change their state. Note that even if we used level
    /// triggering we'd still need to do this, but for a different reason. The timer would fire
    /// indefinitely as ready in the level triggered case, rather than never firing again as in the
    /// edge triggered case.
